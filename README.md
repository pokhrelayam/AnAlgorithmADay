## Implementation of CS Basics (Sorting Algorithms, Data Structures, Graph Algorithms)
The following sorting algorithms will be implemented first:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort (One end as pivot)
* Quick Sort (Median of three numbers as pivot)
* Radix Sort
